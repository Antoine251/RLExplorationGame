### Demo of the trained agent!

The following low-quality GIF comes from a good quality video that you can see there: [Watch the demo video](media/Demo_RL_game.mp4)

This video is a selection of evaluation episodes. On the left, you can see the 2D tiled map with the players that work in parallel. On the right, you can see the "fake" 3D view of the player in dark green (the player sees the environement in 2D but this view can be rendered in 3D by playing on the rectangles height).
